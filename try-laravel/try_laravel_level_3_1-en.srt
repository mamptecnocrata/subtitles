1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,470
Lettuce head to the farm and get deep into the CRUD.

2
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:15,599
No need to be alarmed — the data's cleaner than the mud.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,653
We'll pep up our app, yes we will.  It's going to be real swell,

4
00:00:19,654 --> 00:00:32,043
so swell, so swell.  Learning MVC is a snap when you're using Laravel.

5
00:00:32,044 --> 00:00:35,363
Welcome back to Try Laravel.  In this section, we're going to learn

6
00:00:35,364 --> 00:00:40,819
about controllers, or the middle man of our application.

7
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,112
The next section in our application stack happens just before the model.

8
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:49,521
It's called the controller layer.  Controllers handle our logic.

9
00:00:49,522 --> 00:00:53,648
It will help us pull data from the model and then call our view while

10
00:00:53,649 --> 00:01:00,569
passing along all of the information that we just got from our database.

11
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,473
To define a new controller, we'll need to create a controller named

12
00:01:03,474 --> 00:01:08,353
the same as the model followed by the name Controller in camel case.

13
00:01:08,354 --> 00:01:14,332
Then inside of that controller file we'll extend Larvel's existing Controller class.

14
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:19,763
These controllers will exist in the app/Http/Controllers folders.

15
00:01:19,764 --> 00:01:26,315
Here are file will be named MarketController.php.

16
00:01:26,316 --> 00:01:30,417
For each route, we'll need a public method, or action.

17
00:01:30,418 --> 00:01:35,152
The index method, or action, will be used to list all of our markets.

18
00:01:35,153 --> 00:01:39,705
We'll make a call to the Market model using the all method returning a

19
00:01:39,706 --> 00:01:43,912
collection of results from the database.  We'll need to send this data

20
00:01:43,913 --> 00:01:49,839
to a view.  We can accomplish this by using the view helper method in Laravel.

21
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,504
The first argument is our view.  Here we're going to the views folder

22
00:01:53,505 --> 00:01:58,728
by default, then the markets folder, and then the index.blade.php file

23
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:02,602
that we created in the last level.  This second argument will then

24
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:07,201
pass the collection markets to the view by adding an array with the

25
00:02:07,202 --> 00:02:10,961
key of markets.

26
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:13,878
Now that we have the model call in the controller, we don't need to

27
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:18,103
create the markets collection here in the view, so we can remove it.

28
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:21,309
Since we've passed along the markets from the controller to the view,

29
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,523
everything else will remain the same.

30
00:02:25,524 --> 00:02:29,339
To show a single market within the same controller, we can create a

31
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,160
different method named show, this time with an argument for the single Market item.

32
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:39,522
Laravel automatically binds the Market object to the ID that's in the

33
00:02:39,523 --> 00:02:44,269
URL so we don't have to run any queries.  If no market is found,

34
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:49,172
it will generate a 404 for us.  Then our view is the same,

35
00:02:49,173 --> 00:02:52,547
but we're now calling the show template and passing through the

36
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:57,835
argument key as Market instead of markets.

37
00:02:57,836 --> 00:03:00,987
Again, we just remove the logic that queries the model,

38
00:03:00,988 --> 00:03:07,394
and everything else just keeps working as expected.

39
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,429
In this section, we've learned about controllers for logic,

40
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,406
we've learned about using methods to render views, and how to remove

41
00:03:14,407 --> 00:03:18,666
our logic from our views.  Now it's time to take some challenges,

42
00:03:18,667 --> 01:00:00,000
and I'll see you in the next section.
