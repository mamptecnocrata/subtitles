00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,645
Welcome back to Try Laravel.  In this section, we're going to talk

2
00:00:05,646 --> 00:00:11,244
about views, or what you, the viewer, sees.

3
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:15,546
Now back at our application stack diagram, let's talk about the next

4
00:00:15,547 --> 00:00:19,692
piece of the puzzle, the views layer.  The views layer is where we

5
00:00:19,693 --> 00:00:23,732
decide how to display our information back to the browser.

6
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:27,017
From here, we'll set up our templates and layouts that allow us to

7
00:00:27,018 --> 00:00:36,331
format our data with HTML and CSS and a template syntax in Laravel called Blade.

8
00:00:36,332 --> 00:00:40,737
Our views will be in the Resources folder of our project and then in a

9
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:42,407
folder called views.

10
00:00:42,408 --> 00:00:45,977
Here we'll create a set of folders and files that can be used from

11
00:00:45,978 --> 00:00:50,285
within our application.  Any view specific to a model should live in

12
00:00:50,286 --> 00:00:55,228
their own folder under the views folder.  In this case, we have a view

13
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:59,533
that's specific to the markets table, so we have a markets folder and

14
00:00:59,534 --> 00:01:06,341
then a view underneath it called show.blade.php.

15
00:01:06,342 --> 00:01:10,266
Blade is the template language that's built into Laravel.

16
00:01:10,267 --> 00:01:14,602
In order to use the Blade syntax and PHP code blocks, we'll have to

17
00:01:14,603 --> 00:01:18,670
name our files with the extension .blade.php.

18
00:01:18,671 --> 00:01:23,680
In this case, it's show.blade.php, which we're going to use to look at

19
00:01:23,681 --> 00:01:27,673
a single market.  Here you can see a standard HTML file at the

20
00:01:27,674 --> 00:01:31,525
beginning and then some new syntax.  If we want to echo information to

21
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:35,676
the screen, we'll use a set of opening curly braces and then end that

22
00:01:35,677 --> 00:01:41,110
echo with the closing curly braces.  @php is how we start a simple

23
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:45,837
PHP-only block, and then we would end it with @endphp.

24
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:49,991
Notice that here we're making a call to our model and find of the ID

25
00:01:49,992 --> 00:01:54,192
of 3, so this page wants to show the ID of 3.

26
00:01:54,193 --> 00:01:57,872
And then we're using the Blade syntax to echo the market name,

27
00:01:57,873 --> 00:02:03,119
the market city, and then an anchor tag to create a link and show the market website.

28
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:14,295
With no styles, we can see how this page will look rendered to the browser.

29
00:02:14,296 --> 00:02:17,639
Now if we want to show all markets, we're going to create a new file

30
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,894
named index.blade.php and then change the content.

31
00:02:22,895 --> 00:02:27,462
Here you can see inside of our @php tags we're changing it to Market

32
00:02:27,463 --> 00:02:31,285
and a call to all to give us a collection of markets.

33
00:02:31,286 --> 00:02:36,655
Then we're using looping constructs @foreach ($markets as $markets) so

34
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,574
that we can loop through each of the markets in the collection and

35
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:42,857
show a link to the website of that market.

36
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:47,529
If you notice, we have some repeated code between our show.blade.php

37
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:53,665
file and our index.blade.php file, which is our framing HTML.

38
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:57,560
We'll want to clean up our code as much as possible to dry up our

39
00:02:57,561 --> 00:03:02,539
code, or don't repeat yourself.  Blade helps us do just that by giving

40
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,967
us the ability to create layouts.  In this case, we want to keep our

41
00:03:06,968 --> 00:03:11,478
HTML markup header and the footer the same throughout the project and

42
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:15,989
just change the content.  We can do that by creating a file called

43
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:23,246
app.blade.php and placing it in a folder named layouts inside of our views folder.

44
00:03:23,247 --> 00:03:27,971
Then we can define areas for each of our custom views to modify by

45
00:03:27,972 --> 00:03:31,889
defining an @yield tag with the name of the section.

46
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,074
Here I'm calling that section main.  Then, inside of our

47
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:41,441
index.blade.php file, we can remove all but the content we need for

48
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:45,016
that page and place a few new items at the top.

49
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:49,674
The first is the @extends command to tell us that this file is the

50
00:03:49,675 --> 00:03:55,647
extension of the layouts.app file.  The layouts.app string can also be

51
00:03:55,648 --> 00:03:59,556
looked at as a folder, or a slash, in the file path.

52
00:03:59,557 --> 00:04:03,107
Next, we're going to define the section we want to modify with the

53
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:08,211
@section tag and the string argument of the section name main.

54
00:04:08,212 --> 00:04:11,200
Then at the end of all of our content, or custom code,

55
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:14,635
we'll close that section with @endsection.

56
00:04:14,636 --> 00:04:19,448
Each new file we create will have an @extends and @section inside of

57
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:29,035
it so we don't have to repeat our framing HTML code.

58
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:32,119
In this section, we've learned about creating views.

59
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,296
We've learned about the Blade template syntax and using Blade to

60
00:04:36,297 --> 00:04:40,154
create layouts so that we can dry up our code.

61
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:45,665
Now it's time for you to take some challenges, and I'll see you in the next level.

62
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,219
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

63
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,019
Or we can (gibberish).

64
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,389
We're getting a (noises).

65
00:04:54,390 --> 01:00:00,000
Once we find a record.
