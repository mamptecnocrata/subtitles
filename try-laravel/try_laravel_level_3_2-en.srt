00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,607
Welcome back to Try Laravel.  In this section, we're going to talk

2
00:00:05,608 --> 00:00:11,568
about routing, or controlling our traffic.

3
00:00:11,569 --> 00:00:14,938
The final layer in our application stack is routing.

4
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:19,098
Routing is the director of traffic for our entire application.

5
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:22,992
It sees the URL that comes in from the request and decides where to

6
00:00:22,993 --> 00:00:30,327
send that request in the application based on what we place in our routes file.

7
00:00:30,328 --> 00:00:33,874
The routes file lives in the routes folder at the root of our

8
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:39,224
application, and any web-based routes will happen in web.php.

9
00:00:39,225 --> 00:00:43,568
Let's go over some simple examples.  The first thing we'll do is use a

10
00:00:43,569 --> 00:00:48,713
new class called Route followed by a static method get.

11
00:00:48,714 --> 00:00:53,660
Get is directly related to the get HTTP method, so as you might

12
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:57,059
expect, we could also use the post method here.

13
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,984
In this case, we will use get followed by two arguments.

14
00:01:00,985 --> 00:01:04,933
The first argument will be the URL that we're trying to match.

15
00:01:04,934 --> 00:01:08,334
If we use forward slash, we'll be looking for the root path,

16
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:13,294
or in most cases, the home page, with no other URL information.

17
00:01:13,295 --> 00:01:18,746
The second argument is a callback, or a function to run if this URL is matched.

18
00:01:18,747 --> 00:01:22,336
In this example, I'm using a closure, or anonymous function,

19
00:01:22,337 --> 00:01:27,161
to return a string of Hello World.  The Route class will return this

20
00:01:27,162 --> 00:01:31,657
as an HTTP response with the body of Hello World.

21
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:36,272
We can also accept arguments in the URL.  The next example,

22
00:01:36,273 --> 00:01:42,457
let's use the URL pattern of market/ followed by the ID as the argument.

23
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:47,175
To specify an argument, we will use the open and closing curly braces

24
00:01:47,176 --> 00:01:50,775
surrounding the name of our argument.  Then, in our closure,

25
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:54,300
we'll pass through that same name as an argument variable,

26
00:01:54,301 --> 00:02:00,395
then return in the closure a string containing that ID.

27
00:02:00,396 --> 00:02:03,917
Since we're using controllers, we'll need to pass URL's specific

28
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:08,159
methods in each controller.  We can do this by sending a string as the

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,516
second argument instead of a closure.  This way we're able to handle

30
00:02:12,517 --> 00:02:17,385
the logic from our route in the controller instead of our route's file.

31
00:02:17,386 --> 00:02:20,967
We reference the method in the controller by writing a string

32
00:02:20,968 --> 00:02:24,553
containing the class of the controller, followed by the at sign,

33
00:02:24,554 --> 00:02:28,602
and then the method name.  Let's walk through the examples of a normal

34
00:02:28,603 --> 00:02:34,806
RESTful CRUD routing list.  Many of our get request URLs you have seen

35
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:40,118
in the first lesson, such as the markets/create to make a new market.

36
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:44,839
That form will need to post to the markets URL, and we will direct it

37
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,330
to the store method inside of the markets controllers.

38
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:53,570
Another is when we want to find a specific market by market ID.

39
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:59,634
Here we use a wildcard to pass the market ID to the show action in our controller.

40
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:03,479
In the first example, if we were to hit markets/create, that would

41
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,787
direct a get request to the MarketController@create method.

42
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:12,853
In the second example, if we were to hit markets/3, it would pass

43
00:03:12,854 --> 00:03:19,197
through the ID of 3 to the markets controller show method.

44
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:22,198
We will also want to edit specific markets.

45
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:27,610
Here we can add /edit after the market and map that market wildcard to

46
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:31,026
our edit action inside of the MarketController.

47
00:03:31,027 --> 00:03:34,839
If we want to delete an item, we'll set up a delete route that maps to

48
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:42,527
the destroy action on the same controller using an ID wildcard.

49
00:03:42,528 --> 00:03:46,307
Laravel makes creating all of these routes even easier for us by

50
00:03:46,308 --> 00:03:50,637
giving us a route method called resource.  Resource routing expects

51
00:03:50,638 --> 00:03:55,847
that a URL pattern will always relate to a specific controller and related model.

52
00:03:55,848 --> 00:03:59,157
This is why naming has been so important to us.

53
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:03,204
Here, instead of defining each route individually, now we can just use

54
00:04:03,205 --> 00:04:08,139
Route::resource followed by our URL pattern base, which is markets,

55
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,751
and then the controller name with no method specified.

56
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:20,497
With this single line of code, we now have all of the following routes.

57
00:04:20,498 --> 00:04:23,464
In this section, we've learned about routing with closures,

58
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:28,099
CRUD routing, and resource routing with models and controllers.

59
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,871
Now it's time for you to take some challenges, and I'll see you in the wrap-up video.

60
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:35,632
Framework, vlah.

61
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:38,028
Lara (noises).

62
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:40,623
Notice we have some ch.

63
00:04:40,624 --> 01:00:00,000
Call our vule, vule.  Is that like zool?
