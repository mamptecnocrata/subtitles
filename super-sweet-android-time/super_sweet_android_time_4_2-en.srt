00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,911
Welcome back.  In this section we're actually going to store candy

2
00:00:05,912 --> 00:00:09,670
data in our database.

3
00:00:09,671 --> 00:00:13,834
We want to save candies to the database after we get the candy array

4
00:00:13,835 --> 00:00:19,151
from the API.  Remember the code we wrote for our network request?

5
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:26,842
The onSuccess callback method is where we'll add candies to our database.

6
00:00:26,843 --> 00:00:31,125
We'll create a method, addCandiesToDatabase, to save each candy to

7
00:00:31,126 --> 00:00:39,405
the database and call that at the bottom of the onSuccess method.

8
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:44,087
Before we create that method, we'll also add a candyDbHelper

9
00:00:44,088 --> 00:00:48,950
variable to the top of the MainActivity class so that we can access

10
00:00:48,951 --> 00:00:55,227
it throughout the main activity.  Now let's define that

11
00:00:55,228 --> 00:01:00,729
addCandiesToDatabase method at the bottom of the MainActivity class.

12
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,765
The return type will be void since we don't need to return anything,

13
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:09,841
we're just adding to the database, and we need to pass in our array

14
00:01:09,842 --> 00:01:16,783
of candy so that we can add each one to the database.

15
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:21,008
To access our database, we can use the getWritableDatabase method

16
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:26,171
from our candyDbHelper, and we'll store a reference to that database

17
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:31,628
in a SQLiteDatabase variable called db.

18
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:35,650
Since we'll need to access each candy individually to add it to the

19
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:40,598
database, we'll create a loop that accesses each candy one at a time

20
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:47,116
from the candies array.  The ContentValues class will help us insert

21
00:01:47,117 --> 00:01:51,569
values into the database by doing some data validation and ensuring

22
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,692
data gets inserted in the correct format.

23
00:01:56,693 --> 00:02:01,706
We then put each column name and value into the ContentValues object

24
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:09,820
with the put method, and we'll do this same thing for the rest of our candy's properties.

25
00:02:09,821 --> 00:02:13,936
Finally, we can use the insert method to insert the new candy row

26
00:02:13,937 --> 00:02:18,307
into our database.

27
00:02:18,308 --> 00:02:22,295
Now that we have our candies in our database, the next step is to use

28
00:02:22,296 --> 00:02:26,257
them in our app.  But first, it's time for you to practice adding

29
00:02:26,258 --> 01:00:00,000
data to your database in the challenges.
