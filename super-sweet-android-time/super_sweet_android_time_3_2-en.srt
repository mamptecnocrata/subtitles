00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,664
Welcome back.  In this section we're going to use the Picasso image

2
00:00:05,665 --> 00:00:11,600
library to load our images into our ImageView.

3
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:15,568
Instead of writing this somewhat lengthy code to download images

4
00:00:15,569 --> 00:00:20,189
into our app and cache them, Picasso is an Android library we can

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,295
use to do this for us.

6
00:00:24,296 --> 00:00:28,275
We need caching because getting files from a distant web server

7
00:00:28,276 --> 00:00:33,258
takes much longer than getting locally cached images from memory.

8
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:38,381
How caching works is, if the image exists in our local cache memory

9
00:00:38,382 --> 00:00:42,614
from a recent request, we can load it from there.

10
00:00:42,615 --> 00:00:46,312
Otherwise, we'll download the image from the web server,

11
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:51,603
but also save it in our local cache for next time.

12
00:00:51,604 --> 00:00:55,529
Just like we did before with our async and GSON libraries,

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,499
to use Picasso we need to add it as a dependency to the bottom of

14
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:06,106
our app's build.gradle file.

15
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:11,178
Now that Picasso has been included in our project, we can use it in our code.

16
00:01:11,179 --> 00:01:16,795
We use Picasso.with to set the context of where the image will be

17
00:01:16,796 --> 00:01:23,747
used, which is this activity, then the load method sets the URL where

18
00:01:23,748 --> 00:01:29,073
Picasso will download the image from, and then the into method sets

19
00:01:29,074 --> 00:01:33,662
the ImageView where we're going to display the image.

20
00:01:33,663 --> 00:01:38,286
Remember, by using Picasso, Android Studio should automatically add

21
00:01:38,287 --> 00:01:42,525
the following import line to the top of your file, but if it doesn't,

22
00:01:42,526 --> 00:01:50,876
you can add it yourself.  Now let's get Picasso into our detail activity.

23
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:54,911
Just like before, we first need to get the image URL passed in with

24
00:01:54,912 --> 00:01:59,730
the intent and also find our ImageView by its ID.

25
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:06,320
Then we can use Picasso to load our image into our ImageView.

26
00:02:06,321 --> 00:02:14,235
And that's it.  Now we can see our image loading from our image URL we passed in.

27
00:02:14,236 --> 01:00:00,000
That's it for level 3.  Now it's time for you to give Picasso a try in the challenges.
