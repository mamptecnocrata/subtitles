00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,764
Welcome back.  We've requested some JSON data, we've parsed it into

2
00:00:06,765 --> 00:00:10,574
an array of candy objects, and now we'd like to pass some of that

3
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:13,881
data to the detail activity.

4
00:00:13,882 --> 00:00:18,429
Right now our detail activity is only showing the candy name,

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,711
but we'd like it to also show the price, description, and image that

6
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:26,893
we got from our Candy API.  To do that, we can get the image, price,

7
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:34,695
and description from the array of candy objects and send it to the detail activity.

8
00:00:34,696 --> 00:00:38,873
We can pass these properties to the detail activity with the intent

9
00:00:38,874 --> 00:00:43,630
like we originally did with the name.  This would be in the onItemClick

10
00:00:43,631 --> 00:00:48,261
callback method.  We'll also want to use the candies array we just

11
00:00:48,262 --> 00:00:53,145
created, so we'll change it to a class variable by declaring it at the

12
00:00:53,146 --> 00:00:57,531
top of the MainActivity class.  This will allow us to access the

13
00:00:57,532 --> 00:01:01,633
candies array and all of the methods in this class, not just the

14
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:06,412
onSuccess callback method.  We can use the putExtra method to

15
00:01:06,413 --> 00:01:10,808
pass the image, price, and description by referencing those properties

16
00:01:10,809 --> 00:01:16,869
from the candies array, like this.

17
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,271
Back in the DetailActivity class, we can get the image,

18
00:01:20,272 --> 00:01:24,325
price, and description we passed in after we display the candy

19
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:28,316
name in the TextView.  But before we display them to the screen in

20
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:35,426
our app, let's first log them to make sure they're coming in correctly.

21
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:38,773
We can get our passed in values from the intent with the same

22
00:01:38,774 --> 00:01:43,607
getStringExtra method we used for the candy name, then we'll log

23
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:51,611
these properties with the Log.d method to make sure they look correct.

24
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,407
Like before, we also want to add some checks to make sure these

25
00:01:54,408 --> 00:01:58,203
values actually exist to prevent errors.

26
00:01:58,204 --> 00:02:01,733
Now we should have our values logging in the detail activity.

27
00:02:01,734 --> 00:02:05,529
Let's jump over to Android Studio to see if those values are coming

28
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,217
into the detail activity.

29
00:02:09,218 --> 00:02:14,363
If we look at our DetailActivity.java file in our onCreate method at

30
00:02:14,364 --> 00:02:20,942
the bottom, we can see our log message logging the image, price, and description.

31
00:02:20,943 --> 00:02:24,703
Let's see this working by running our app, then to start our

32
00:02:24,704 --> 00:02:28,246
DetailActivity we need to click on a candy.

33
00:02:28,247 --> 00:02:32,428
Now if we go into our Android monitor under the logcat tab,

34
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:37,743
we should see our log message.  There it is marked DetailActivity,

35
00:02:37,744 --> 00:02:43,956
and it shows the Intent data with the image URL, price, and description.

36
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:47,566
Now we know that this data is being passed correctly to the detail

37
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:54,157
activity and we can work on actually displaying it in the user interface.

38
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:57,864
That's it for level 2.  Now it's time for you to practice passing your

39
00:02:57,865 --> 00:03:02,131
response data to an activity.

40
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:05,841
Get it with the.

41
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:08,609
We need to write some.

42
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,574
To delete our tabrle.

43
00:03:11,575 --> 01:00:00,000
Challenges.
