1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,975
We've got our eyes on the sky searching for PHP life.

2
00:00:06,976 --> 00:00:11,896
We'll use POST requests to track extraterrestrial guests.

3
00:00:11,897 --> 00:00:18,200
Validation and security will lock things down in a hurry.

4
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:31,233
We want to believe these Close Encounters with PHP.

5
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:37,914
Welcome back.  Let's move on to includes and requires.

6
00:00:37,915 --> 00:00:41,709
Our index.php file is starting to get a little crowded, and this is

7
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:48,227
only for a small amount of code, so how can we better approach this problem?

8
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:53,089
We can start to clean and organize our code by relocating our header,

9
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,414
our footer, and our content sections.  We can take these new sections

10
00:00:57,415 --> 00:01:02,495
called HTML blocks or partials and place them back into our index.php

11
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:06,615
file with a single line.  We can also include some compartmentalized

12
00:01:06,616 --> 00:01:10,589
code, and we can add a new folder structure for our project.

13
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,089
Let's start by creating an app folder and a public folder both in the

14
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:23,223
root of your project and then move our index.php file into the public folder.

15
00:01:23,224 --> 00:01:28,216
Then inside of our app folder we're going to create a new folder called views.

16
00:01:28,217 --> 00:01:35,064
This is going to be used to hold all of our new HTML blocks or partial files.

17
00:01:35,065 --> 00:01:38,548
Then you're going to need to create three new files inside of the

18
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:47,744
views folder, one for the content, one for the footer, and one for the header.

19
00:01:47,745 --> 00:01:50,654
After all the files are created, we're going to need to cut each

20
00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:56,329
section of code from our index.php file and paste it into our new files.

21
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,738
Here we're taking the header information from the index.php file and

22
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:05,222
placing it in the header.php file in our app/views folder.

23
00:02:05,223 --> 00:02:12,362
Now we must include the file back into our index.php file.

24
00:02:12,363 --> 00:02:16,375
Where we removed the code from our index.php file, we're going to

25
00:02:16,376 --> 00:02:20,030
create a new code block, and inside of our code block we're going to

26
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:24,348
use a new PHP function or keyword called include.

27
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:28,343
We can add code from another location to be processed within our

28
00:02:28,344 --> 00:02:32,310
index.php file using the include function.

29
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:37,291
Here we're including app/views/header.php.

30
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:40,880
If you notice, there are two dots and a slash before app.

31
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:44,945
This means we want to move back or look back one directory.

32
00:02:44,946 --> 00:02:49,477
Since our index.php file is inside of our public folder,

33
00:02:49,478 --> 00:02:53,012
we're going to want to move one directory back outside of the public

34
00:02:53,013 --> 00:03:01,211
folder and then move into our app/views folder to access our header.php file.

35
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:05,824
We'll need to do the same for content.php by moving it from the

36
00:03:05,825 --> 00:03:11,331
index.php file into our content.php file, then replacing the code

37
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:16,050
we've just removed from the index.php file with our include function

38
00:03:16,051 --> 00:03:21,951
pointing to our new content.php file.

39
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:28,850
Then we'll apply the same process to our footer.php file.

40
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:32,779
Here is our new index.php file.  Much cleaner.

41
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,019
Now let's do some challenges.  When you come back, we'll move our PHP

42
00:03:37,020 --> 01:00:00,000
code outside of the index.php file.
