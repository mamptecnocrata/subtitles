00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,932
Welcome back.  Now that you understand includes, let's move on to requires.

2
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:14,566
We're going to want to move our code out of the index.php file.

3
00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:18,330
At first, this is going to be a way for us to keep our code clean.

4
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:22,621
We almost always end up with multiple files containing different bits

5
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:27,150
of PHP code.  This will help keep our code organized by using unique

6
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:32,676
meaningful file names, which will help us find and work on our code later.

7
00:00:32,677 --> 00:00:36,807
Now we're going to create a new folder underneath our app directory.

8
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:40,751
We're going to call this folder source, or src.

9
00:00:40,752 --> 00:00:45,791
Inside of this folder, we're going to create a new file named app.php.

10
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:48,775
This is where we're going to keep all of our code for the project

11
00:00:48,776 --> 00:00:53,649
instead of in the index.php file.

12
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,032
Once our new file has been created, we're going to want to cut and

13
00:00:57,033 --> 00:01:03,744
paste all of our code from the index.php file into our new app.php file.

14
00:01:03,745 --> 00:01:07,402
One thing to notice is that files that contain only PHP, such as our

15
00:01:07,403 --> 00:01:15,288
app.php file, and no HTML, we will not need a closing PHP tag.

16
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:17,661
We're essentially repeating the process that we did in the last

17
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:24,351
section by including our new app.php file inside of our index.php file

18
00:01:24,352 --> 00:01:28,460
with one major difference.  The difference here is the use of the

19
00:01:28,461 --> 00:01:31,899
require function instead of the include function.

20
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,399
They behave the same except if the file is missing or not found when

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,188
using an include statement, you'll get a warning.

22
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:43,765
If you use a require and the file is not found, it will throw a fatal error.

23
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:48,481
Let's take a closer look at the difference between these two.

24
00:01:48,482 --> 00:01:52,199
We're going to force the error to happen by changing our name from

25
00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:01,329
app.php to foo.php where foo.php does not exist in our source directory.

26
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,353
This will give us a fatal error, or a 500 error if we're in

27
00:02:04,354 --> 00:02:10,580
production, and the page will not load.  Now to take a look at the

28
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:17,990
opposite behavior, let's change this require to an include.

29
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:21,775
Notice now the error has changed to a warning, and also you'll notice

30
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:28,825
that the HTML will still display underneath of our warnings.

31
00:02:28,826 --> 00:02:34,028
Now inside the index.php file you can see that we have requires and includes.

32
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:39,234
The main PHP logic is required; however, the HTML, or the partials,

33
00:02:39,235 --> 00:02:43,349
are only included.  From here on out, we'll only go back to the

34
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:49,272
index.php file if we need to include or require some new code.

35
00:02:49,273 --> 00:02:53,359
Enjoy the challenges, and I'll see you soon.

36
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,329
Include.  What was that?

37
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,920
Oh, so close, so close.

38
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:04,580
Ekking on --- (Noises).

39
00:03:04,581 --> 00:03:06,994
Ekking.  (Laughing).

40
00:03:06,995 --> 01:00:00,000
Ekking the data screen bad.
