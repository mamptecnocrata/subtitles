00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,953
Lettuce head to the farm

2
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:10,804
and get deep into the CRUD

3
00:00:10,805 --> 00:00:13,242
No need to be alarmed—

4
00:00:13,243 --> 00:00:15,890
our data's cleaner than the mud.

5
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:19,642
We'll pep up our app, yes we will, it's gonna be real swell.

6
00:00:19,643 --> 00:00:21,212
So swell, so swell.

7
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:32,174
Learning MVC is a snap when you're using Laravel.

8
00:00:32,175 --> 00:00:35,323
Welcome back to From Form to Table with Laravel.

9
00:00:35,324 --> 00:00:40,676
This level is all about setting up our database.

10
00:00:40,677 --> 00:00:44,024
To set up our database, we're going to need to configure the database

11
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:49,035
connection information, create our actual database with MySQL,

12
00:00:49,036 --> 00:00:54,397
and then run our migration to set up our table and columns.

13
00:00:54,398 --> 00:00:59,403
To create our database, we'll use the MySQL command line tool or CLI.

14
00:00:59,404 --> 00:01:03,643
If you don't have MySQL installed on your machine, you can go to the

15
00:01:03,644 --> 00:01:07,765
link below to get directions on how to install a local development copy.

16
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:13,822
Start by typing mysql -u, and then the username, which is root,

17
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:18,101
and then -p to signal that you want to use a password for access.

18
00:01:18,102 --> 00:01:22,668
Enter your root user password for MySQL, and then press Enter.

19
00:01:22,669 --> 00:01:26,388
This will place you inside of the MySQL monitor.

20
00:01:26,389 --> 00:01:30,450
Then we're going to run the command create database market followed by

21
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:35,246
a semicolon.  This instructs MySQL to create a database named market.

22
00:01:35,247 --> 00:01:42,327
Once we've done this, we can type exit to exit the CLI.

23
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:46,159
Now that our database has been created, we'll need to configure

24
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,605
Laravel to use the market database.  We'll accomplish this by using a

25
00:01:49,606 --> 00:01:54,662
.env or environment file.  Our .env file can be found in the root

26
00:01:54,663 --> 00:01:59,487
folder of our project, and it already has some configurations set up

27
00:01:59,488 --> 00:02:02,347
for us by default.  We'll need to change the database field to reflect

28
00:02:02,348 --> 00:02:07,333
our database name, which is market.  We'll also need to enter our

29
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:11,275
user, root, and our password.  In this case, it's also password.

30
00:02:11,276 --> 00:02:15,987
Laravel will now read this file when running our local development

31
00:02:15,988 --> 00:02:18,345
server using Artisan.

32
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:22,872
The last step in configuring the database is to run our migrations

33
00:02:22,873 --> 00:02:27,031
for the markets table.  We can accomplish this by using Artisan and

34
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:29,265
running the command migrate with no arguments.

35
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:32,583
This will run all migrations waiting to be run.

36
00:02:32,584 --> 00:02:38,288
Once the migration is run, you should get a success message.

37
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:42,817
To verify that our migrations ran, we can go back to our MySQL

38
00:02:42,818 --> 00:02:46,386
monitor or CLI.  Once you log in to the monitor, you can run the

39
00:02:46,387 --> 00:02:50,101
command use market followed by a semicolon.

40
00:02:50,102 --> 00:02:55,945
This command will set the monitor to run all queries against the markets table.

41
00:02:55,946 --> 00:03:00,237
Now we can run the command show tables followed by a semicolon,

42
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:02,611
and all tables in the market will be listed.

43
00:03:02,612 --> 00:03:06,887
You should see a markets table, as well as a migrations table

44
00:03:06,888 --> 00:03:12,974
that helps keep track of all migrations made to the database.

45
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:17,705
As a review, we've configured our database inside of Laravel by using

46
00:03:17,706 --> 00:03:23,509
a .env file.  We've created a database in the MySQL monitor.

47
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:28,687
Then we ran all migrations on the newly setup database.

48
00:03:28,688 --> 01:00:00,000
Now it's time to do some challenges, and I'll see you in the next section.
