1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,953
Lettuce head to the farm

2
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:10,804
and get deep into the CRUD

3
00:00:10,805 --> 00:00:13,242
No need to be alarmed—

4
00:00:13,243 --> 00:00:15,890
our data's cleaner than the mud.

5
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:19,642
We'll pep up our app, yes we will, it's gonna be real swell.

6
00:00:19,643 --> 00:00:21,212
So swell, so swell.

7
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:32,708
Learning MVC is a snap when you're using Laravel.

8
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:37,030
Hi!  I'm Hampton Paulk.  Welcome to From Form to Table with Laravel.

9
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:40,200
In this level, we'll be working with the Laravel installation and the

10
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:44,191
setup of a new project.

11
00:00:44,192 --> 00:00:47,289
In this first section, we're going to download the Laravel installer

12
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,633
using Composer, create a new application called Market, start up a

13
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:59,245
local server, and review Laravel's CLI or command line interface.

14
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:02,726
The first step is to download the latest version of the Laravel

15
00:01:02,727 --> 00:01:06,936
installer with Composer.  We're going to install it globally to our

16
00:01:06,937 --> 00:01:09,920
system so that we can create a new application.

17
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:13,887
Begin by navigating to the folder you want to keep the project in.

18
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:18,143
I'll be creating it in the Home folder, but you can create the

19
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:21,658
application wherever you like.  Next, we'll want to run the following

20
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,386
command:  composer global require, followed by the installer vendor

21
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:32,597
and package, which is laravel/installer.  This may take a little time.

22
00:01:32,598 --> 00:01:37,985
But once it's complete, you will find something similar to the following.

23
00:01:37,986 --> 00:01:42,330
Now that our installer is ready, we can run the command laravel new,

24
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:45,954
followed by the name of our app, which I will call market.

25
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:51,296
Once this command runs, you'll be back to the prompt.

26
00:01:51,297 --> 00:01:55,208
In order to change directory to our market, we'll use the CD,

27
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:58,616
or change directory, command followed by the folder that was just

28
00:01:58,617 --> 00:02:03,219
created, which is market.  Once we're in the folder, we can test the

29
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,312
installation by running the local server.  Type the following command:

30
00:02:07,313 --> 00:02:13,145
php artisan serve.  The server will take over the terminal,

31
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:16,675
so when you're wanting to exit the server, press the Ctrl+C keys to

32
00:02:16,676 --> 00:02:21,368
terminate the server.  While the server is running, you can visit

33
00:02:21,369 --> 00:02:32,250
127.0.0.1:8000, which is telling us we're visiting the local host at port 8000.

34
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:39,746
Once you navigate to the URL, localhost:8000 or 127.0.0.1:8000,

35
00:02:39,747 --> 00:02:43,129
you should see the following page.  This simple splash page will

36
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:48,765
give you a link to the documentation and other helpful sites.

37
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:52,958
Our next step will be to create a model so that we can interact

38
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,385
with our database through our application.

39
00:02:54,386 --> 00:02:59,526
We'll do this by using Laravel's Artisan command line interface.

40
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:03,896
We will use the make command to create a model and at the same time

41
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:07,687
create a migration, which will help us manage our database table row

42
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:11,526
and column structure.  We'll talk more on this in a few.

43
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:17,366
All of the following items will be done from our terminal.

44
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:24,066
To start, we'll type php artisan, and the help make:model.

45
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:28,515
You can use help without a command, or you can place help in front of

46
00:03:28,516 --> 00:03:31,263
any command to get information about that command.

47
00:03:31,264 --> 00:03:35,495
Here we can see that the command takes some optional arguments and

48
00:03:35,496 --> 00:03:38,393
one required field for the name of the model we want to create.

49
00:03:38,394 --> 00:03:42,123
If we want to create a migration to go along with our model,

50
00:03:42,124 --> 00:03:46,206
we can pass the -m flag as our option.

51
00:03:46,207 --> 00:03:54,950
Now we can run php artisan make:model -m, and the singular

52
00:03:54,951 --> 00:04:00,306
capitalized model name of Market.  This will create our Market and a migration.

53
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:03,917
Using Laravel's standard naming, it will call our table markets,

54
00:04:03,918 --> 00:04:08,989
which is the lowercase plural of our model name.

55
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:12,322
Here's what our new model looks like out of the box.

56
00:04:12,323 --> 00:04:15,638
It's under the namespace App, and we're extending the Eloquent\Model

57
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:20,660
class so that we get all the awesome functionality of the Eloquent ORM.

58
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:24,270
Now all we need to do is configure our database.

59
00:04:24,271 --> 00:04:28,479
We do that with migrations.

60
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,945
Our migration file will be in the database parent folder and then in

61
00:04:31,946 --> 00:04:38,325
the migrations folder.  You'll see the name create_markets_table

62
00:04:38,326 --> 00:04:41,771
prefaced by the date and timestamp that it was created.

63
00:04:41,772 --> 00:04:46,394
Our migration files allow us to version control our database and

64
00:04:46,395 --> 00:04:50,088
tightly control what each table contains.

65
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,918
By default, the markets table will be created with an

66
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:58,468
auto-incrementing ID and timestamps for created and modified times.

67
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:04,270
We'll need to extend this a bit to include our own fields.

68
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:07,656
To begin with, we'll add a column of a string type and call it name.

69
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:11,388
This will be the name of our farmer's market.

70
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:15,911
We'll also want this name to be unique so that no two entries can

71
00:05:15,912 --> 00:05:19,582
have the same market name.  Then we'll add two more columns of the

72
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:27,031
same string type, one for the city and one for the website.

73
00:05:27,032 --> 00:05:30,767
In this level, we've learned about installing Laravel's installer with

74
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:35,853
Composer, using Laravel's installer to create a new application.

75
00:05:35,854 --> 00:05:40,640
We've learned about Artisan serve to create a local web server.

76
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:44,050
And we've learned how to create a model with migrations.

77
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:50,107
Now it's time for you to do some challenges, and I'll see you in the next level.

78
00:05:50,108 --> 00:05:56,709
That was terrible.  It was like I just swallowed localhost.

79
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,977
(Laughing)

80
00:05:59,978 --> 00:06:03,117
We're going to drop the base, the database.
