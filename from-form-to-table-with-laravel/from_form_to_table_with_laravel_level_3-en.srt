1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,953
Lettuce head to the farm

2
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:10,804
and get deep into the CRUD

3
00:00:10,805 --> 00:00:13,242
No need to be alarmed—

4
00:00:13,243 --> 00:00:15,890
our data's cleaner than the mud.

5
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:19,642
We'll pep up our app, yes we will, it's gonna be real swell.

6
00:00:19,643 --> 00:00:21,212
So swell, so swell.

7
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:31,627
Learning MVC is a snap when you're using Laravel.

8
00:00:31,628 --> 00:00:38,574
Welcome back!  In this level, let's work with controllers and views.

9
00:00:38,575 --> 00:00:41,729
In order to get our Market app up and running, we'll need to display

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,412
a list of all the markets.  But to do that, we're going to need to get

11
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:49,125
our controllers, routing, and views all set up.

12
00:00:49,126 --> 00:00:53,092
In this level, we'll create our controller, create RESTful methods for

13
00:00:53,093 --> 00:00:58,298
CRUD, or Create/Read/Update/Delete, connect our routes to the

14
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:02,560
controller through the routing file.  Then we'll set up our view by

15
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:07,291
querying all the markets and passing that along to a view from within the controller.

16
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:14,412
We'll need to create that view and use Blade to loop through all the results.

17
00:01:14,413 --> 00:01:17,969
In order to create our controller, we'll need to go back to our

18
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,056
Artisan command line tool.  Once we're in the terminal, we'll need to

19
00:01:22,057 --> 00:01:28,305
run the following command--php artisan help make:controller.

20
00:01:28,306 --> 00:01:32,778
By using help before our command, we'll see the documentation on the

21
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:35,584
command, and we're able to look at some of our options.

22
00:01:35,585 --> 00:01:39,813
Here, the argument that's required is the name of the controller.

23
00:01:39,814 --> 00:01:45,131
But we can also pass the option of -m and the model name to create a

24
00:01:45,132 --> 00:01:49,076
resource controller for that model.

25
00:01:49,077 --> 00:01:52,166
In our case, we're going to want to pass the market model to the

26
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:55,864
command to generate the MarketController.

27
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:59,666
To do this, we'll run the same command as before without the word

28
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:03,986
help and then follow that with a -m and the name of the model, Market.

29
00:02:03,987 --> 00:02:08,868
And for the name, we'll use MarketController in CamelCase.

30
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:15,270
Once you press Enter, you will have created the MarketController.

31
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:18,186
If we open the controller that was just created located at

32
00:02:18,187 --> 00:02:25,950
app/Http/Controllers and the name MarketController.php, we'll see our

33
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:30,510
new resource controller.  By passing the -m flag,

34
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:35,540
it automatically created our index, show, create, save, and destroy

35
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:39,437
methods for us with the expected arguments, such as the response and

36
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:44,396
request objects and our models.

37
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:48,605
In order to link our URLs to our controller, we'll need to work on

38
00:02:48,606 --> 00:02:52,871
our routes file in the routes directory and web.php.

39
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:57,649
We've looked at routes before in Try Laravel where we can link URLs to

40
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,343
anonymous functions to return data.  But in this case, we want to use

41
00:03:02,344 --> 00:03:04,993
the resource route so that we can create all the routes needed to work

42
00:03:04,994 --> 00:03:10,255
with a model resource.  Here we will add the Route class followed

43
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,932
by the resource method followed by two arguments.

44
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:17,209
The first argument is the name of the URL pattern to look for,

45
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,038
which is markets, then the controller name to route through.

46
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:25,341
Here it's MarketController.  Close that line with a semicolon,

47
00:03:25,342 --> 00:03:28,052
and we now have access to all of these routes.

48
00:03:28,053 --> 00:03:31,872
For example, if you navigate to the markets URL, it will be a GET

49
00:03:31,873 --> 00:03:37,115
request that then directs to the MarketController and the index action.

50
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:40,751
We also have ones for create, which maps to the create action.

51
00:03:40,752 --> 00:03:46,191
We also have a POST request to markets that allow us to store using

52
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:49,094
the MarketController and the store action.

53
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:53,253
You'll also see similar actions for the URLs for destroy, update,

54
00:03:53,254 --> 00:03:56,903
show, and edit.

55
00:03:56,904 --> 00:04:00,974
Another way to see all of our routes and at the same time check that

56
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:05,563
our routes file is providing all the correct routes is to use Artisan.

57
00:04:05,564 --> 00:04:09,565
To see all the routes in the application, you'll run php artisan

58
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:15,503
route:list, and then press Enter.  Now you can see the method,

59
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:19,983
URL pattern, controller, and action pair, as well as the context of

60
00:04:19,984 --> 00:04:24,345
each route in the application.

61
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:28,488
The first method that we'll be modifying is the index method,

62
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:31,723
which is used to display all of the markets in the application.

63
00:04:31,724 --> 00:04:36,062
The first line of code inside the index action will be our call to

64
00:04:36,063 --> 00:04:42,149
query the model for all markets and then store it in a collection named $markets.

65
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,478
Then we'll want to return a view.  We can do this by returning the

66
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,661
output of a view helper in Laravel.  The view helper will take two arguments.

67
00:04:51,662 --> 00:04:55,736
The first is the template folder file name in dot notation.

68
00:04:55,737 --> 00:05:01,339
Here we're using the markets folder and then the index.blade.php view,

69
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:06,354
which we'll create soon.  Then we'll pass an array of arguments to that view.

70
00:05:06,355 --> 00:05:11,817
In this case, our only argument is the markets collection $markets.

71
00:05:11,818 --> 00:05:16,938
We'll pass that with a key of markets.

72
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:21,533
The index view will be created in a new folder named markets under

73
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:25,786
the resource/views folder.  All new market-related views should be

74
00:05:25,787 --> 00:05:31,446
created under this markets folder.  Our index file should be named

75
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:37,559
index.blade.php so that we can use the Blade template syntax.

76
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,479
Next, we'll need to create some basic HTML and then place an unordered

77
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:49,187
list tag set in the middle of our body.  Using Blade syntax,

78
00:05:49,188 --> 00:05:53,681
we'll create a foreach loop and loop through all of our markets.

79
00:05:53,682 --> 00:05:58,080
Start with the @ symbol, add foreach, and then in a set of

80
00:05:58,081 --> 00:06:03,846
parentheses, you'll loop through all $markets as $market.

81
00:06:03,847 --> 00:06:09,065
Then you'll close that loop with @endforeach.

82
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:13,480
Each time the loop runs, the data in $market will change to reflect

83
00:06:13,481 --> 00:06:19,274
the item in the $markets collection.

84
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:22,266
Now let's create a link to each of the markets.

85
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:26,655
We can do this with a list item inside the foreach loop block,

86
00:06:26,656 --> 00:06:29,504
and then each of the list items you'll add an anchor tag.

87
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:34,839
We can do this with a list item inside of the foreach loop block.

88
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,961
And in each of the list items, you'll add an anchor tag.

89
00:06:38,962 --> 00:06:43,106
The anchor tag's value will be the name property of the market object.

90
00:06:43,107 --> 00:06:48,516
We can access this with the Blade curly mustache syntax, and then the

91
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:51,197
name $market followed by the object operator, and then the property

92
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:57,012
name, which is name.

93
00:06:57,013 --> 00:07:00,768
Now let's use the route helper and create the URL that we want to

94
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:04,692
link to for each of the markets.  We can do this again with the

95
00:07:04,693 --> 00:07:07,871
mustache syntax and a call to the route helper.

96
00:07:07,872 --> 00:07:10,324
The first argument will be the name of the route.

97
00:07:10,325 --> 00:07:14,655
Remember, named routes are created for you when you use the resource

98
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:18,469
route type in the routes file.  The second argument is the object

99
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:23,344
itself, which Laravel will use to extract the ID of the market.

100
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:27,612
This command will create a string URL for you that will link to the

101
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,527
market by ID.

102
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:33,782
Let's review all that we've learned in this level.

103
00:07:33,783 --> 00:07:38,502
We've learned how to create a controller using the php artisan CLI.

104
00:07:38,503 --> 00:07:43,323
We've learned how to use the -m flag to generate a resource controller.

105
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:47,850
We've configured a resource route to map CRUD actions to our routes.

106
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:51,743
We've used the CLI to view all the routes in our application.

107
00:07:51,744 --> 00:07:54,966
We've learned how to query our database for all markets.

108
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:58,781
We've passed the query results to a view for display.

109
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:01,842
We've created an index template using Blade.

110
00:08:01,843 --> 00:08:04,691
We've looped through all of our markets with Blade.

111
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:10,664
And we've displayed a link to the market show page.

112
00:08:10,665 --> 00:08:14,403
Now it's time for you to take some challenges, and I will see you in

113
00:08:14,404 --> 01:00:00,000
the next level.
